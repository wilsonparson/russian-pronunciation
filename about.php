			<h1>About This Tool</h1>
		
				<p>From 2011 to 2013, I served as a missionary of the <a href="">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> in the Russia Yekaterinburg mission. To prepare to teach and serve the people of Russia, I spent three months in the <a href="">Missionary Training Center (MTC)</a> learning the Russian language. Pronunciation of hard and soft vowels and consonants was one of the most valuable language principles that I learned in the MTC. I worked on my pronunciation every day throughout the mission, and I believe that it played an important role in helping me build trust and form relationships with people that I consider some of my closest friends.</p>

				<p>After I returned home from my mission, I worked as a teacher at the MTC for three years, and I made it a point to teach each group of missionaries about hard and soft pronunciation. As I was teaching, I realized that there was hardly any written instructional material on the subject, so I created this website for a class project.</p>

				<p>The content of this learning tool is based on instruction from my MTC teacher, Chris Storey, as well as on material from Nicholas J. Brown's book <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Penguin-Russian-Course-Beginners/dp/0140120416">The New Penguin Russian Course: A Complete Guide for Beginners</a></i>.
