			<h1>4. The Soft Л</h1>
		
				<p>The Soft Л is one of the hallmark sounds of a <q>good</q> Russian accent. However, most English speakers are not accustomed to pronouncing soft л's. In general, English speakers use hard л's when pronouncing English words. For example, try saying the word <q>love</q> a few times. As you do so, pay extra attention to the tip of your tongue. When you say the <q>L</q> of love, the tip of your tongue probably makes contact either with your upper front teeth, or with a spot right behind them (see <i>Fig. 1</i>). This is a hard л.</p>

                <button type="button">love (hard л)</button>

				<p>Now repeat the word "love" again, only this time try moving the tip of your tongue back, so that it makes contact with the center of your hard palate, instead of with your front teeth (see <i>Fig. 2</i>). If you're doing it correctly, the L of love should start to sound different. This is a soft л. One comparison that may help is the Spanish word for hello, <i>hola</i>. When you say <i>hola</i> with a "good" Spanish accent, you are using a soft л. When you say <i>hola</i> with an American accent, you are using a hard л.</p>
