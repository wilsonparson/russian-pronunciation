		<p>Welcome to "Hard and Soft Pronunciation in the Russian Language: A How-to Guide with Audio." This guide will cover the basics of pronunciation of hard and soft vowels, and hard and soft consonants in the Russian language. To navigate through the guide, refer to the sidebar on the right side of the page. As you move through the guide, you will come across many tables containing Russian words. Many of the cells of these tables are active, and when clicked upon will play short audio clips demonstrating proper and/or improper pronunciation. Press the button below to begin!</p>
		<p>This tool is intended for Russian-learning missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as will be reflected in the choice of example words and audio clips. However, I hope this tool will be helpful for anyone seeking to improve their Russian pronunciation.</p>
