  <h2>Hard and Soft Consonants</h2>
  <p>All Russian consonants (with two <a href="exceptionsAlwaysSoft.html">exceptions</a>) are naturally <q>hard</q> consonants. When a consonant is followed by a <a href="index.html">hard vowel</a>, the consonant maintains its hard pronunciation. When a consonant is followed by a <a href="index.html">soft vowel</a>, the consonant is pronounced <q>softly.</q> For example, the consonant л is naturally hard. When it is followed by a hard consonant, as in лы, the л is still pronounced hard. When it is followed by a soft vowel, as in ли, the л becomes <q>soft.</q> We will discuss the exact pronunciation of soft consonants on the next page. For now, just keep this one principle in mind: <strong>a soft vowel makes the consonant before it soft as well</strong>.</p>
