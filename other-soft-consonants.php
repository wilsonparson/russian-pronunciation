				<p>The <q>Tips</q> column at the right includes some formulas for pronunciation. The word <q>smile</q> suggests that the speaker's pronunciation becomes more shallow, as if he or she is <q>smiling.</q> These soft consonants are not nearly as noticeable as the soft л or soft т. However, you might hear a slight difference in how the words are pronounced when comparing the audio from the <q>Hard Pronunciation</q> column to the <q>Soft Pronunciation</q> column.</p>
